It's me Gaston. You've probably never heard of me. And i've never thought of writing a README for myself.
Usually READMES are written for apps and software, but here i am writting a README about me. READ me 😄!

I am a person with a high sense of responsibility, great problem-solving capacity and very committed. 
I have previous experience working with groups and I consider myself a very adaptable person.

When im not coding im probably 
learning some new stuff, playing some casual games or doing crossfit at the gym!
