It's me Gaston. You've probably never heard of me. And i've never thought of writing a README for myself.
Usually READMES are written for apps and software, but here i am writting a README about me. READ me üòÑ!

I am a person with a high sense of responsibility, great problem-solving capacity and very committed. 
I have previous experience working with groups and I consider myself a very adaptable person.

When im not coding im probably 
learning some new stuff, playing some casual games or doing crossfit at the gym!

If you are looking to expand your team. Do not hesitate to contact me!
